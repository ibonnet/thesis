    In the heart of Venezuela's capital, Caracas, lies one of the world's largest slums, Petare. It'd been three hours since the sun set, but the center of Petare was alive with the sound of drums, the clinking of cold Polar beers, and the dancing of hundreds of people. Among them was Noa Iimura.
</p>
<p>
    Noa, who grew up in Japan, was living in the US when he decided to go traveling alone across Latin America. With the ambition to immortalize his surroundings through 360 degrees videos, he sat down to plan his trip.
</p>
<p>The first six months went according to plan. He had already crossed six countries, from Belize to Colombia, and was on his way to Brazil to watch the FIFA World Cup. “Venezuela was the only country where I hesitated to visit,” he said. When he shared the plans of his trip, everyone told him that he would get robbed if he stood foot in the country. “But the people telling me not to go had never been there themselves.”</p>
<p>Despite the warnings, Noa booked his flight. When he finally arrived, his one-month trip became a six-months stay in Venezuela.
